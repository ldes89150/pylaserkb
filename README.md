pylaserkb
=========
Bascally, this project comes from team RoboPeak's project, [laserkbd](https://github.com/robopeak/laserkbd). 
In our project, we adopted the same hardware design as team RoboPeak's.
However, instead of C++, all of our code was written in pure Python.
This makes our code be able to run in all OS with Python and OpenCV and easy to be modified.
